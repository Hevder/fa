             <b>Its second sentence is so important it gets marked additionally.</b>

        <blockquote>"Then comes a longer quotation from long ago that makes you think."</blockquote>
        <p>In the second paragraph there is nothing interesting.
         But after the second <br> paragraph there is an image of a tree.
